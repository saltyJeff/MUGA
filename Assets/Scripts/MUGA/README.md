# MUGA
Make UNET Great Again

## Installation
1. Download all of this repo
2. Download [MessagePack](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp) with the Unity3d extensions
3. Profit (I'll put up a tutorial soon)

## Features
I pretty much read [this](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking) and [this](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization) and turned it into C# in Unity
* Authoritative server
* Lag Compensation (see LCPhysics class)
* Latency Interpolation
* Client-Side prediction
* Input Sampling and allows you to share movement code between Client and Server for simple prediction
